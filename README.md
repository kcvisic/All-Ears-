# Description
All Ears is an interactive music streaming site, where you can listen to your favorite tunes while chatting with new friends or old friends. We Goobers believe in connecting people through the power of music, and what better way for people to experience music together than through the web?
Groove Rooms are where the magic happens. This where the admin (logged-in user who creates the room) can customize the room with an artist or song. From there, the admin and his room's visitor can chat away as they listen in harmony.
